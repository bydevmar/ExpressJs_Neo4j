# ExpressJs_Neo4j

This repository contains an example Express.js application integrated with Neo4j, a graph database.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to use Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js, together with Neo4j, a highly scalable graph database, to build web applications that leverage graph data models.

## Features

- Integration of Express.js with Neo4j using the neo4j-driver package.
- CRUD operations with Neo4j graph data using Cypher queries.
- RESTful API endpoints for managing users, platforms, posts, and relationships between them.
- Error handling and validation of incoming requests.

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ExpressJs_Neo4j.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   cd ExpressJs_Neo4j
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure your Neo4j database connection in the `app.js` file.

4. Start the Express.js server:

   ```bash
   node app.js 
   ```

5. Your server should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

- Use Postman or a similar tool to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints for CRUD operations.
- Refer to the API documentation or the source code for details on available endpoints and request/response formats.
